            The magnetic <em>City of Light</em> draws visitors from around the globe who come to see iconic attractions like the <em>Eiffel Tower</em>, the <em>Louvre</em> and the <em>Arc de Triomphe</em>. But what travelers really fall in love with are the city's quaint cafes, vibrant markets, trendy shopping districts
            and unmistakable je ne sais quoi charm. Get lost wandering along
            Paris' cobblestone streets, or grab a croissant and relax on the
            banks of the Seine for hours. If you're up for a quick daytrip, head
            about 15 miles southwest of the city center to another must-see
            attraction: the <em>Palace of Versailles</em>.

            New Zealand's South Island brims with majestic landscapes at every
            turn, from dramatic mountains to fjords to glaciers. Here, you can
            admire the mountains of <em>Fiordland National Park</em>, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site, from hiking trails or a boat on Milford Sound. At
            night, journey to the <em>
              University of Canterbury's Mount John
              Observatory
            </em> to gaze at the starry skies. You can also indulge your
            inner daredevil in Queenstown, explore two of the most accessible
            glaciers in the world on the island's west coast or sample delicious
            food and wine in the Marlborough region.

            What this small French Polynesian island may lack in size it makes
            up for in sheer tropical beauty. Here, you'll find picturesque
            beaches, lush jungles and luxurious resorts. The island's dormant
            volcano, <em>Mount Otemanu</em>, makes for a great photo-op or challenging
            hike, and the friendly Bora Bora locals can help you catch a glimpse
            of the island's best sights during an off-road excursion. To relax,
            head to <em>Matira Beach</em> for crystal-clear water and soft sand. Although
            a trip to Bora Bora is very expensive, most travelers say it's worth
            every penny.
